## INTRODUCTION

In this kernel we will use various predictive models to see how accurate they are in detecting whether we can correctly predict which comapnies will face bankrptcy in the future. As described in the data section, the dataset contains:

95 features (X1-X95, business regulations of Taiwan Stock Exchange)
1 Vector of labels
Our aim in this project is to use these features to understand their impact/role on the selected models and how they can help us recognizing the companies that are close to bankrupcty. Let's start!
